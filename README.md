# Simulation-of-the-Queensland-Government-Customer-Care-Call-Centre

● The objective of this project is to design a working simulation model of the Queensland Government Customer Care Call Centre located in Beaudesert, Australia.

● To design a conceptual model of the Customer Care Call Centre and perform discrete event simulation using Arena software.

● To perform Sensitivity Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation in Microsoft Excel and determine the average waiting time and serve time of each customer.
